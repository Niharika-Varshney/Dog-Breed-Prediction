# Dog Breed Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting dog breeds from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).
